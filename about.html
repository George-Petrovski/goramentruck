            <p>I am currently in my third semester at Seneca College for the program Computer Programming and Analysis that I started in 
                January of 2021 and have maintained a 4.0 GPA throughout the program. It has been a tough few years and the pandemic 
                has taught me to be resilient and never give up. I’m currently building a few web applications by learning the material on 
                my own that will be taught in a few semesters down the road. I enjoy working independently as well as in a group to create 
                useful projects that can be adapted and configured to work in a variety of settings for larger scale projects.</p><br> 
            <p>I have explored the React framework and made some simple projects like a To Do list application (can be viewed on Heroku: 
                <a href="https://intense-depths-30796.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">https://intense-depths-30796.herokuapp.com/</a>) and 
                an anonymous forum posting application using the latest encryption and authentication methods (
                   <a href="https://hidden-earth-93222.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">https://hidden-earth-93222.herokuapp.com/</a>). I also 
                   collaborated with a group of 5 people during the Bell sponsored Hackathon to create an environmentally sustainable solution 
                   using technology (<a href="https://rocky-anchorage-47766.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">https://rocky-anchorage-47766.herokuapp.com/</a>).</p><br> 
            <p>Previously, I was working as an account manager at a staffing firm where I learned to communicate effectively and listen attentively to 
                meet and exceed the clients expectations. I characterize myself as an extremely hard worker that’s willing to go above and beyond because 
                I know that many people depend on the work that I do and I’ll be making a lot of people really happy by getting my assignments finished ahead of 
                schedule. Time management is one of my strongest skills that I acquired during my time at the University of Waterloo where I studied the natural 
                sciences while also juggling a few teaching assistant roles and working in residence as a community leader. I’ve learned to be engaging and 
                thoughtful while also fostering an environment where students can create connections to make school life more enjoyable. I love to 
                create and build out tools and projects so that we can increase efficiencies and have a more interconnected world.</p>
